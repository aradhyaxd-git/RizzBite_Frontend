## üöÄ Local Development Setup

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)
-   npm or yarn
-   A Firebase project for authentication.
-   A Google Gemini API Key.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/rizzbite.git](https://github.com/your-username/rizzbite.git)
    cd rizzbite
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend:**
    ```sh
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
    PORT=5000
    # Add your Firebase Admin SDK config variables here
    ```
    Start the backend server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Setup the Frontend:**
    ```sh
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory and add your Firebase client config and backend URL:
    ```
    VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
    VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
    VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
    VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
    ```
    Start the frontend development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

Your application should now be running locally, with the frontend at `http://localhost:5173` (or similar) and the backend at `http://localhost:5000`.
